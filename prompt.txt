write a program in javascript which reads a file and displays its content in browser's webpage input field and allows to modify that file from that webpage using input field and buttons.
generate both html and javascript code and they should be linked together in one file named index.html. here are some detailed requirements,

A simple page with a resizable input field, and a script tag with scripts inside it. body should have a backgound colour of light green.
 The script is used to edit the configuration file stored in local pc not on server as this also works when offline.
 The script should allow the user to select the configuration file using file manager when select button is pressed, or use default if load-default button pressed.
 default file path is "c://user/desktop/config.cfg".
 The function in script should be called with a query string parameter configfilename a varible, which stores the name of the configuration file to be edited.
 The script should display the contents of the configuration file in a form's input element named configfilename when load-default button is pressed.
 The script should allow the user to edit the contents of the configuration file.
 The script should automatically save the contents of the configuration file when its modified in input filed.
 The script should create a copy as text file on same location/path, as soon as something changes in original loaded file.

 
  // above js code is not working and is not loading the file, given these
  reasons: // 1. the file is not being loaded from the path given in the query
  string parameter // 2. the file is not being loaded from the default path //
  3. the file is not being loaded from the path selected by the user // 4. the
  file is not being saved to the path selected by the user // these were the
  requirements of the task // The script is used to edit the configuration file
  stored in local machine. // The script should allow the user to select the
  configuration file using file manager when select button is pressed, or use
  default if load-default button pressed. // default file path is
  "c://user/desktop/config.cfg". // The function in script should be called with
  a query string parameter configfilename a varible, which stores the name of
  the configuration file to be edited. // The script should display the contents
  of the configuration file in a form's input element named configfilename when
  load-default button is pressed. // The script should allow the user to edit
  the contents of the configuration file. // The script should automatically
  save the contents of the configuration file when its modified in input filed.
  // The script should create a copy as text file on same location/path, as soon
  as something changes in original loaded file. // this below is the updated
  javascript code for the above described task with all the requirements
  fulfilled.
